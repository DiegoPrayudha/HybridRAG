# Hybrid RAG: Combining Keyword Search and Vector Search

## Overview
This project implements a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** approach that combines two retrieval techniques: **Keyword Search** and **Vector Search**.

- **Keyword Search (Sparse Retriever)**: This is a traditional method where a search query is matched with exact or closely related terms in a document collection using a keyword-based approach.
- **Vector Search (Dense Retriever)**: This method uses semantic meaning to retrieve relevant documents, ensuring that even if the query words donâ€™t match exactly, the system can still return relevant results.

## Technology Stack
The project leverages the following tools and models:

- **Groq**: Selects the LLM model for text generation.
- **LangChain**: A framework for developing RAG-based applications.
- **Hugging Face**: Provides pre-trained models for embedding.
- **ChromaDB**: A vector database for storing and retrieving vectorized data.
- **BM25**: A ranking algorithm used in information retrieval systems to estimate the relevance of documents to a given search query.

## Features
The system includes three main functionalities:

1. **Upload Data**  
   - Supports uploading PDF documents as external knowledge sources for the chatbot.

2. **Hybrid Search**  
   - Performs **Keyword Search** and **Vector Search** on the query and ensembles the results.

3. **Response Generation**  
   - Generates responses based on the retrieved data from the hybrid search.

## Approach: Dense Retriever & Sparse Retriever
1. Insert external data into the vector database.
2. When a query is received, perform **Hybrid Search** (combining keyword-based and semantic search).
3. Ensemble the results from both retrieval methods.
4. Use the retrieved data to generate an accurate and relevant response.

## Result
- The chatbot can answer queries using a **Hybrid Search** approach.
- The responses are **more relevant** and **better aligned** with the query.
